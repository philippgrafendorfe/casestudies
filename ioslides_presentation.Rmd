## Tools, techniques and perception

> - Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning
> - Reporting
> - Interactive Shiny- application on Microsoft R Server
> - Azure ML Services
> - R is good for Machine Learning
> - Python is better

## Highlights

- Pivoting
- Interactive apps
- Good algorithm for testing (xgboost)
- Webservice deployment with Azure ML Studio

## Pivoting

1. Import data from database (SQL)
2. Transform Dataframe from long to wide with additional aggregation
3. Present better readable dataframes


## Result of database query
```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(data.table)
df <- fread(input = 'sample_df.csv', select = c(2,3,4), data.table = F)
print(df[1:10,])
```


## Pivot Table with utf-8 issue
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
pivot <- fread('user_vs_details.csv')
print(pivot[1:10,1:5])
```


## XGBoost

- Gradient Boosting Tree Algorithm
- Supervised Learning
- Cross Validated results
- Parallelization
- Continued Training
- Free open source
- Fast


## Access xgboost

- R interface as well as a model in the caret package
- Command Line Interface (CLI)
- C++ (the language in which the library is written)
- Python interface as well as a model in scikit-learn
- Julia
- Java and JVM languages like Scala and platforms like Hadoop


## Microsoft Azure ML Webservices

### Hot
- Easy pseudo- wysiwyg training
- Easy webservice implementation
- on-demand computational power

### Not
- No code hands-on, therefore no finetuning
- Limited possibilities in modeling and special libraries
